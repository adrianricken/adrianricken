### About Me
After being born and raised in the south of Germany near Freiburg i'm living in Berlin for almost 8 years now.
At TU Berlin i did my Bachelor's degree in Architecture from 2016-2020 and worked as an intern at AFF Architekten for 6 months afterwards.
Then the second pandemic wave hit and from january - august 2021 i was part of one of the vaccination centers here in Berlin.
In october 2021 i started my master's degree at HCU Hamburg but wasn't too happy there which is why i tried to change back to Berlin. 
As that didn't work out and i wasn't too happy about the work as an architect in general i thought of going an alternate path and came in touch with coding / web development.
